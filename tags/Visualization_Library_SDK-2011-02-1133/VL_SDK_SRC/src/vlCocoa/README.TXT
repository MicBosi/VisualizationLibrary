THE FORMER COCOA BINDINGS HAVE BEEN REMOVED DUE TO THEIR UNSATISFACTORY IMPLEMENTATION QUALITY.

Unfortunately I am not a Mac user so I cannot implement it myself. However if you are a Mac OS X 
programmer and would like to contribute to VL a great way of doing it is to implement a Cocoa 
binding with relative Cocoa_tests and Cocoa_example as for Win32 or Qt4. You can use Qt4Widget 
as a guide. 

It shouldn't get more than a few hours for an experienced Cocoa programmer to do so. Basically 
the whole thing should boil down to translate the Qt4 examples and bindings to Cocoa logic.

If you need help feel free to contact me, I will be happy to assist. 

Of course I will be happy to credits your name among VL contributors if you whish so.


Regards,

Michele Bosi
