	\page pagShaderMultipassLODAnim Shader Multipassing, LOD and Animation Tutorial

	This tutorial shows some advanced techniques related to Shaders. You will learn how to perform multipassing, how to define LODs 
	(level of detail) in your Effects and how to animate your Shaders using the vl::ShaderAnimator class.

	Visualization Library allows you to define quite intricate effects combination setups. You can in fact define several level of detail modes
	for your Effects. Each level of detail defines its own set of Shader passes, that is, VL will draw the object once for each pass using the 
	corresponding Shader. And on top of all you can also animate your Shaders by defining a subclass of vl::ShaderAnimator and binding it
	to the Shader you want to animate!
	
	The following example renders a simple scene with a few cubes. At LOD #0 the cubes are rendered using two passes. The firs pass renders the 
	geometry using two textures out of which the second is animated using a roto-scaling effect. The second pass uses an animated outline 
	blinking shader. At LOD #1 the cubes are rendered using two passes again. But in this case the first pass uses a simple non animated texture. 
	The second pass uses again the outline blinking animated shader. At LOD #2 the cubes are rendered with a single pass using a simple texture.
