	<b>GENERAL QUESTIONS</b>
	<hr>

	<h2>What is Visualization Library and what can I do with it?</h2>
    
    \ref pagIntro
     
	<h2>Under which licensing terms is visualization library distributed?</h2>
    
    \ref pagLicensing
     
	<h2>Is Visualization Library free of charge?</h2>
    
    Yes, absolutely and completely!
     
	<h2>Can Visualization Library be used for Open Source projects?</h2>
    
    Yes.
    
	<h2>Can Visualization Library be used for proprietary and/or commercial projects?</h2>
    
    Yes. And again: yes, you don't need to pay a penny, just report proper credit as stated in \ref pagLicensing.
    
    A link back to Visualization Library's website is also very welcome.
    
	<h2>Who is developing Visualization Library?</h2>
    
    Michele Bosi is the principal author of Visualization Library. You can find full credits in \ref pagCredits.
	Contact information can be found in \ref pagIntro.
     
	<h2>Which operating systems does VL support?</h2>
    
    VL supports Windows XP, Vista and 7, Linux and Mac OS X.
     
	<h2>What is the state of Mac OS X support?</h2>
    
    Since I cannot personally check the state of VL functionalities under Mac OS this task is left to the users' community.
	As far as I know there are quite a few users developing Mac OS applications using VL, so I am quite confident that it
	works even if I don't get regular updates from them. However, usually if there are problems they are minor compilation 
	fixes which get promptly fixed.
     
	<h2>What does the "VL" abbreviation stays for?</h2>
    
    Guess what? VL = Visualization Library.
     
	<h2>What is the meaning of VL's version number?</h2>
    
    Instead of using fancy version numbers VL uses a very simple scheme, for example:
	Version 2010.10.1500 actually means YEAR.MONTH.BUILD_NUMBER. Bug fix versions which retain API compatibility with an older version
	differ only in their build number. An even build number identifies an \a officially \a stable release, while an odd build number identifies
	a \a development \a milestone release. No garbage releases are publicly distributed so even the \a development \a milestone releases are 
	usually quite stable as they must pass all the regression tests (with the possible exception of some GUI bindings not properly working) and 
	don't contain known major bugs. I personally advice VL users to keep up to date with the dev milestone releases as much as possible.
     
	<h2>Does VL support DirectX? Does VL support OpenGL ES?</h2>
	
	VL does not support DirectX and most likely will never support it. 
	VL provides experimental support to OpenGL ES 1.1 and 2.0 which I tested only under PowerVL emulators at the moment.
	
	<h2>What background knowledge is needed to use VL?</h2>
	
	Familiarity with the C++ language and compilers such as GNU G++ and MS Visual C++. Some OpenGL and linear algebra knowledge is highly 
	beneficial. For more info see \ref pagLearning.
	
	<h2>Can VL be used from languages other than C++?</h2>
	
	Not that I know, but I think you can build bindings using tools such as ToLua++, SWIG etc.
	
	<h2>How can I get notified of new VL releases?</h2>
    
    The most up to date source of information is VL forums (http://www.visualizationlibrary.org/forum) and twitter page (http://twitter.com/VizLibrary).
    
	<h2>Where can I download Visualization Library?</h2>
    
    Here: http://www.visualizationlibrary.org/documentation/downloads.php
     
	<h2>Are there binary distributions?</h2>
	
	No, for simplicity VL is distributed in source code format only. However the source code provides all the most common dependencies such as libz, libpng, libjpeg, freetype etc. which are automatically built for you.
	
	<h2>How do I compile and install Visualization Library?</h2>
    
    See the \ref pagInstall page for the full instructions.
     
	<h2>How do I compile and run the example and test applications?</h2>
    
    When configuring CMake tick the checkbox relative to the GUI examples you want to compile. For ex. "VL_GUI_WIN32_EXAMPLES" will compile the \a 
	win32_example.exe and \a win32_tests.exe applications. Running the \a win32_tests.exe application without parameters will print out the list
	of available tests and options.
     
	<h2>Are there tutorials about VL?</h2>
	
	VL comes with a few official tutorials, see \ref pagGuides. 
	
	As far as I know no user has yet written any tutorials or articles about VL. 
	I like to think this is because VL is damn easy to use! ;)
	
	<h2>Are there books about VL?</h2>
	
	No books are available yet.
	
	<h2>Where can I get more help</h2>
	
	In the forum: http://www.visualizationlibrary.org/forum
