  /**
   * The ActorTree class implements a generic tree whose nodes contain Actor[s]. Each node of the tree can have any number of children.
   *
   * Use this class when you want to have direct control over how the Actor[s] are
   * grouped together or to implement specific space partitioning schemes like
   * BSP trees, Quadtrees, Octrees etc. For example you can use the ActorTree class 
   * to build a quadtree by assigning 4 children per node and filling them appropriately.
   * Of course you can also use an ActorTree to group a set of Actor[s] based on any other
   * principle. For example animated Actor[s] are usually kept in separate "flat" trees 
   * (for example all in a single node) as the computational cost of rebuilding every frame 
   * the BSP tree, Quadtree, Octree etc. might be to high.
   * 
   * Note that for performance reasons the ActorKdTree class derives from the ActorTreeAbstract 
   * and implements a space partitioning scheme (based on a binary tree) where the splitting 
   * planes are in turn choosen so that they are aligned to the world space x, y and z axes.
