	<div class="featuretitle">Visualization Library 2011.09.1155</div>

	- <b>New VLX framework</b>:
		- Several VL classes can now be saved and restored to VLT (text) and VLB (binary) files, including: vl::Actor, vl::Shader, vl::Effect, vl::Transform, vl::GLSLProgram and vertex/fragment/geometry/tess-evaluation/tess-control shaders, vl::Uniform, vl::Light, vl::Material, vl::Texture, vl::Camera, vl::DepthSortCallback, vl::PixelLODEvaluator and vl::DistanceLODEvaluator, all draw calls and vl::Array subclasses and several others.
		- The framework allows the user to add or subclass a class wrapper for serialization following a few simple steps.
		- The VLX framework is a sort of XML designed to efficiently represent numerical data and complex networks of objects referencing each other. It can be used to represent any type of data also besides VL classes. The VLX is much less verbose than XML and at the same time more efficient than JSON to store numerical data. It also allows the embedding of GLSL shaders (or any programming language bascally) with virtually no modification or encoding. This means that you can edit 99.99% of GLSL shader code directly in a VLT file as is, which is impossible in XML and JSON due to the encoding rules they use. References to objects are also automatically resolved when loading or saving VLX files and you can even link multiple VLX files togeter, i.e. a VLX file can refer to an object defined in a separate VLX file and then linked together.
		- VLT and VLB are just representations of a VLX hierarchy. Adding new representations is surprisingly simple actually. For example one could create an XML representation to take advantage of XML validation. There is no VLX validator at the moment. 
		- In the future it will be possible to embed binary blobs in both VLT and VLB representations and the number of wrapped classes will grow to include the missing render states, scene managers, and all the objects necessary to setup rendering pipelines.
	- <b>COLLADA</b>: added support for importing .dae files: geometry, basic materials and lights.
	- vl::PolygonSimplifier: allows also non-ArrayFloat3 input. Now can output multiple mesh resolutions of the same mesh in 1 single run i.e in a fraction of the time previously required.
	- vl::DoubleVertexRemover speed improvements and code cleaning.
	- vl::Geometry updates: 
		- Geometry copy methods policy made coherent with vl::Shader and vl::Effect copy methods.
		- Implemented completely generic vl::Geometry::shrinkDrawCalls() and vl::Geometry::triangulateDrawCalls().
		- Added vl::Geometry::fixTriangleWinding().
		- Added vl::Geometry::mergeDrawCallsWithMultiDrawElements().
		- Added vl::Geometry::mergeDrawCallsWithPrimitiveRestart().
		- Updated vl::Geometry::mergeTriangleStrips() to use index iterators.
		- Refactored vl::Geometry::makeGLESFriendly().
	- vl::DrawElements, vl::MultiDrawElements, vl::DrawRangeElements classes fixed, refactored and retested.
	- vl::Array exposes 'vector_type', 'gl_size' and 'gl_type' to ease template code using them.
	- Added vl::DrawElements::setIndexBuffer() to allow the sharing of index buffers among several draw calls.
	- Added std_types.hpp file exposing basic typedefs, the new vl::degree and vl::radian classes and swapBytes() function to easily swap te byte order of common types.
	- vl::DepthSortCallback code and comments update + allows use of any kind of vertex array.
	- Bug: fixed lag when starting to render text.
	- Various 'const'-ness fixes for better consness enforcing. In particular vl::ref<> now enforces the constness much more strictly.
	- CMake scrips updated to allow debug/release extra library linking.
	- Bug: fixed missing plug-in headers when installing.
	- vl::TexParameter can now be specified also at the vl::TextureSampler level to allow easy COLLADA/DirectX-like effects specification. Essentially this allows a vl::Texture to use more than one vl::TexParameter which might be required in particular use cases.
	- Automatic tracking of previous render states and enables.
	- <b>New indexed render states management</b>:
		- Till now indexed render states such as lights, clipping planes and texture unit related render states had their binding index hardwired in the render state class making it impossible to share the same indexed render states among different shaders with a different index. Now it is possible for a light, a clipping plane etc. to be bound to the same or a different shader with the same or different binding point, maximizing render states reusability and simplifying the code necessary to their management.	
		- Currently indexed render states are: vl::ClipPlane, vl::Light, vl::TexEnv, vl::TexGen, vl::TextureMatrix, vl::TextureSampler, vl::VertexAttrib.
		- Render states management updated to allow \a future support to indexed blending states and enables and later maybe also indexed viewports, depth-range and scissoring at some point...
	- <b>New constant attributes render states to be used in vl::Shader:</b> 
		- vl::VertexAttrib indexed render state: wraps the constant generic vertex attributes.
		- vl::Color, vl::SecondaryColor and vl::Normal: their use can potentially minimize the use of dummy arrays for geometries with attributes whose value does not change across the vertices and allowing the same geometry to be rendered with several different solid colors (which was nearly impossible before).
	- vl::Transform: 
		- Refactored to its original simpler form.
		- Update children local matrix to their world matrix when orphaning.
		- Added vl::Transform::preMultiply() and vl::Transform::postMultiply() methods.
		- Added vl::Transform::flattenHierarchy().
		- Bug: fixed crash when destroying Transforms with children.
	- Bug: fixed vl::Matrix3::getInverse() function, was returning the transpose inverse.
	- Finalized App_DrawCalls demo-test: checks primitive restart, base vertex, MultiDrawElements, index iterators, triangle iterators.
	- Added vl::String::fromPointer() to create a string representing the given pointer.
	- vl::String::normalizeSlashes() now takes care also of . and ..
	- Added VL_UNIX_INSTALL_MODE option to allow VL installation to be done into unix path structure
	- FindVL.cmake: added VL module comments.
	- Bug: fixed FindVL.cmake errors.
	- Bug: fixed installation of vlGraphics/GL folder.
	- pagInstall.dox updated with instructions on how to use VL with a CMake-based project.
	- Several other minor fixes, enhancements and documentation updates.
	- <b>API CHANGES</b>
		- RenderTarget renamed vl::Framebuffer.
		- FBORenderTarget renamed vl::FramebufferObject.
		- vl::LoadWriterManager and vl::FileSystem now use plain std::vector instead of vl::Collection<>.
		- std::string usage rationalized: std::string setters now use "const char*" to minimize the creation of temporary objects.
		- Prefix of IO plugins changed from 'vl' to 'io' i.e. ioVLT, ioVLB, ioDae, io3DS, ioPNG, ioJPG etc.
		- Enforced coherent policy on file names: GLSLmath.hpp -> glsl_math.hpp, math3D.hpp -> math_utils.hpp etc.
		- followTransform() methods renamed boundTransform() for coherency with vl::Camera
		- Removed vl::Log::info() which didn't seem to fit anywhere, added vl::Log::notify() which is a high importance vl::Log::print()
		- vl::DrawElements::indices() renamed vl::DrawElements::indexBuffer()
		- TriangleIterator::isEnd() changed to vl::TriangleIterator::hasNext() and IndexIterator::isEnd() to vl::IndexIterator::hasNext() for better similarity with other APIs (such as Java iterators etc.).
		- FBO API made coherent with other GL resources:
			- create() -> createFBO() and createFBORenderTarget()
			- destroy() -> deleteFBO() and deleteRenderBuffer()		
		- <b>Legacy GPUBuffer / GLBufferObject / VBO language have been completely replaced with the more correct 'BufferObject' language</b>:
			- GLBufferObject renamed vl::BufferObject
			- gpuBuffer() renamed bufferObject()
			- sizeGPU() renamed sizeBufferObject()
			- scalarCountGPU() renamed scalarCountBufferObject()
			- createGLBufferObject() renamed createBufferObject()
			- deleteGLBufferObject() renamed deleteBufferObject()
			- downloadGLBufferObject() renamed downloadBufferObject()
			- mapGPUBuffer() renamed mapBufferObject()
			- unmapGPUBuffer() renamed unmapBufferObject()
			- EGLBufferUsage renamed EBufferObjectUsage
			- EGLBufferAccess renamed EBufferObjectAccess
			- mBufferGPU renamed mBufferObject etc.
		- <b>VBO/BufferObject changes</b>:
			- New vl::EBufferObjectUpdateMode flags for clearer API.
			- \a updateVBO(bool) replaced by \a updateBufferObject(vl::EBufferObjectUpdateMode mode), which now always updates the BufferObjects.
			- \a updateDirtyVBO(bool) replaced by \a updateDirtyBufferObject(vl::EBufferObjectUpdateMode mode), which updates the BufferObjects only if dirty.
			- VL never sets a vl::BufferObject's dirty flag, it is totally under the user's control now. This is to make the behavior of VL more predictable and also avoid unwanted/unnecessary data updates.

   \page pagChangelog Changelog

	<div class="featuretitle">Visualization Library 2010.11.1125</div>

	- <b>Vertex Attrib Set</b> new mechanics for lazy binding of vertex attribute arrays. Mesured around 5% rendering 
	  speedup for complex scenes with several geometries shared by several other actors.
	- <b>Greatly improved vl::Texture</b>: immediate and lazy empty texture creation, better texture format/size 
	  combination support check, each mipmap layer can be manipulated individually, updated documentation.
	- <b>New animation system</b> for vl::Shader and vl::Actor. Removed deprecated virtual method "update()" in 
	  favor of vl::ShaderAnimator and vl::ActorEventCallback. This way one does not need anymore to subclass vl::Actor or vl::Shader

   management, file drag&drop, OpenGL resource sharing, child and top windows 
   support etc.
 - \b VectorGraphics and \b VectorGraphicsScene classes to perform advanced 
   OpenGL hardware-accelerated 2D rendering.
 - \b Terrain \b scene \b manager: implements a simple, kdtree/chunk-based, GPU accelerated (if available), 
   highly memory efficient terrain rendering system (no LOD yet). The system lets you use very large
   height-maps and texture maps that exceed the GPU's maximum texture size. If the host supports OpenGL Shading Language 
   the scene manager keeps on the GPU memory only the heightmap and generates all the geometry on the fly, thus allowing
   very large/detailed terrains.
 - \b Extensible \b resource \b IO \b system (see below)
 - \b ShaderNode class to conveniently managed complex hierarchies of Shaders.
 - \b Progressive \b OpenGL \b extension \b management: if the same functionality is 
   supported via multiple extensions now VL selects and uses the best
   available: first checks direct support by the OpenGL implementation, 
   then checks ARB extensions, then checks EXT extensions.
 - \b Broader \b video \b card \b compatibility including support to integrated ATI and Intel chipsets.
 - \b TrackballManipulator new controls and more precise: now you can 
   zoom in/out with the right mouse button, pan the camera up/down
   left/right with the middle button and rotate with the left button.

   optimize the near/far clipping planes based on the visible objects
   enhancing the everall rendering quality, minimizing z-fighting.

   \par  RESOURCE IO 

 - \b JPG file format support for both load and save.
 - \b PNG file format support for both load and save.
 - Plug-in based ResourceLoaderWriter system. Now you can load and write
   any resource including 3d files and images using the methods 
   LoaderWriterManager::loadResource()/writeResource(). The appropriate
   ResourceLoaderWriter will be picked up and used for the specified
   file type. You can register your own ResourceLoaderWriter to support
   more file formats or to overried existing ResourceLoaderWriter too!
 - Image: new methods convertType() and convertFormat() to convert images
   from/to all the OpenGL 1.1 type/format combinations! For example you
   can convert an IT_FLOAT/IF_RGBA to a IT_UNSIGNED_SHORT/IF_LUMINANCE 
   image! In this case the image is also automatically converted from 
   rgb to gray scale! The alpha channel is also retained when possible.
 - Image: new methods sampleLinear() and sample() to perform nearest-point
   or bilinear filtering sampling of an image. This functions support all
   the OpenGL 1.1 standard image type/format combinations too. This 
   functions can be used to retrieve the color of a pixel, the height
   of a heightmap or to perform collision detection on a heightmap.
 - Image: new method subImage() returns a new image containing the specified
   rectangular pixel area taken from the source image. Also this function
   supports all the OpenGL 1.1 image type/format combinations!
 - Image::makeColorSpectrum() function: creates an 1D image filled with the
   specified color spectrum.
 - Image: new methods substituteColorRGB_RGB(), substituteColorRGB_RGBA(), and
   substituteColorGreenKey() to substitute colors and colorize an Image.
 - All file loaders and writers now use the VirtualFile interface
 - Added write support to DiskFile class.
 - Image loader/writers divided into their own modules: vlPNG, vlJPG, 
   vlTIFF, vlTGA, vlBMP, vlDDS, vlDAT.
 - 3D file loader/writers divided into their own modules: io3DS, ioOBJ, 
   ioAC3D, ioPLY, ioMD2.
 - Autodesk 3DS loader class cleaned and exposed in the vl3DS module to be
   directly used or enhanced by the user.
 - Simplified/unified render states management: RenderStates, ClipPlanes, 
   Light, TextureUnit.
 - New more flexible texture render states: TexGen, TexEnv, TextureMatrix.
 - Lazy allocation of RenderStateSet, EnableSet, UniformSet: uses less 
   memory and object creation/deletion is much quicker.
   
   \par  GEOMETRY 
   
 - GPUBufferInterfaceAbstract new methods: computeBoundingBox(), 
   computeBoundingSphere(), transform() and normalize(). Now you can perform
   all this operations in a GPU-buffer-type-and-layout agnostic way!
 - Geometry primitives quality updates: uses quads instead of triangles when 
   possible, topological fixes for better normal computation.
 - Geometry primitives: draw elements commands minimized and optimized.
 - Geometry::computeNormals() now supports all vertex formats and layouts!
 - Geometry::computeNormals() now supports all the main primitive types: 
   triangles, triangle fan, polygon, quads, tri strips, quad strips!

   view to the model; automatic near/far clipping planes adjustment,
   nicer trackball panning and zooming.
 - New App_VertexFormat: shows several ways to layout vertex data and.
   how to use it in VL. VL support data layout in both Structure-Of-Array.
   and Array-Of-Structures form, spanning a single or multiple buffers!
 - New test App_ImageFunctions: tests image type/format conversion, nearest
   and bilinear sampling, loading and saving in JPG, PNG, TGA, TIFF formats.
 - MorphingActor test simplified and enhanced to show multiple animations.
