	The example below demonstrates how to use an arbitrary GLSL program and transfer function to render a volume. The fragment shader used
	in this example is capable of computing the volume gradient and per-pixel lighting in real-time with up to 4 lights at the same time. 
	It's also capable of taking advantage of a precomputed normal-texture to speedup the lighting computations. You can drag and drop in 
	the window any supported volume data to	visualize it at different threshold level. The threshold level can be modified using the mouse 
	wheel.
