   Includes support to fullscreen windows, multisampling, keyboard and mouse
   management, file drag&drop, OpenGL resource sharing, child and top windows 
   support etc.
 - \b VectorGraphics and \b VectorGraphicsScene classes to perform advanced 
   OpenGL hardware-accelerated 2D rendering.
 - \b Terrain \b scene \b manager: implements a simple, kdtree/chunk-based, GPU accelerated (if available), 
   highly memory efficient terrain rendering system (no LOD yet). The system lets you use very large
   height-maps and texture maps that exceed the GPU's maximum texture size. If the host supports OpenGL Shading Language 
   the scene manager keeps on the GPU memory only the heightmap and generates all the geometry on the fly, thus allowing
   very large/detailed terrains.
 - \b Extensible \b resource \b IO \b system (see below)
 - \b ShaderNode class to conveniently managed complex hierarchies of Shaders.
 - \b Progressive \b OpenGL \b extension \b management: if the same functionality is 
   supported via multiple extensions now VL selects and uses the best
   available: first checks direct support by the OpenGL implementation, 
   then checks ARB extensions, then checks EXT extensions.
 - \b Broader \b video \b card \b compatibility including support to integrated ATI and Intel chipsets.
 - \b TrackballManipulator new controls and more precise: now you can 
   zoom in/out with the right mouse button, pan the camera up/down
   left/right with the middle button and rotate with the left button.
 - \b Near/far \b clipping \b plane \b optimizations. The camera can now optionally 
   optimize the near/far clipping planes based on the visible objects
   enhancing the everall rendering quality, minimizing z-fighting.

   \par  RESOURCE IO 

 - \b JPG file format support for both load and save.
 - \b PNG file format support for both load and save.
 - Plug-in based ResourceLoaderWriter system. Now you can load and write
   any resource including 3d files and images using the methods 
   LoaderWriterManager::loadResource()/writeResource(). The appropriate
   ResourceLoaderWriter will be picked up and used for the specified
   file type. You can register your own ResourceLoaderWriter to support
   more file formats or to overried existing ResourceLoaderWriter too!
 - Image: new methods convertType() and convertFormat() to convert images
   from/to all the OpenGL 1.1 type/format combinations! For example you
   can convert an IT_FLOAT/IF_RGBA to a IT_UNSIGNED_SHORT/IF_LUMINANCE 
   image! In this case the image is also automatically converted from 
   rgb to gray scale! The alpha channel is also retained when possible.
 - Image: new methods sampleLinear() and sample() to perform nearest-point
   or bilinear filtering sampling of an image. This functions support all
   the OpenGL 1.1 standard image type/format combinations too. This 
   functions can be used to retrieve the color of a pixel, the height
   of a heightmap or to perform collision detection on a heightmap.
 - Image: new method subImage() returns a new image containing the specified
   rectangular pixel area taken from the source image. Also this function
   supports all the OpenGL 1.1 image type/format combinations!
 - Image::makeColorSpectrum() function: creates an 1D image filled with the
   specified color spectrum.
 - Image: new methods substituteColorRGB_RGB(), substituteColorRGB_RGBA(), and
   substituteColorGreenKey() to substitute colors and colorize an Image.
 - All file loaders and writers now use the VirtualFile interface
 - Added write support to DiskFile class.
 - Image loader/writers divided into their own modules: vlPNG, vlJPG, 
   vlTIFF, vlTGA, vlBMP, vlDDS, vlDAT.
 - 3D file loader/writers divided into their own modules: io3DS, ioOBJ, 
   ioAC3D, ioPLY, ioMD2.
 - Autodesk 3DS loader class cleaned and exposed in the vl3DS module to be
   directly used or enhanced by the user.
 - Simplified/unified render states management: RenderStates, ClipPlanes, 
   Light, TextureUnit.
 - New more flexible texture render states: TexGen, TexEnv, TextureMatrix.
 - Lazy allocation of RenderStateSet, EnableSet, UniformSet: uses less 
   memory and object creation/deletion is much quicker.
   
   \par  GEOMETRY 
   
 - GPUBufferInterfaceAbstract new methods: computeBoundingBox(), 
   computeBoundingSphere(), transform() and normalize(). Now you can perform
   all this operations in a GPU-buffer-type-and-layout agnostic way!
 - Geometry primitives quality updates: uses quads instead of triangles when 
   possible, topological fixes for better normal computation.
 - Geometry primitives: draw elements commands minimized and optimized.
 - Geometry::computeNormals() now supports all vertex formats and layouts!
 - Geometry::computeNormals() now supports all the main primitive types: 
   triangles, triangle fan, polygon, quads, tri strips, quad strips!

   \par  DEMOS/TESTS

   view to the model; automatic near/far clipping planes adjustment,
   nicer trackball panning and zooming.

   how to use it in VL. VL support data layout in both Structure-Of-Array.
   and Array-Of-Structures form, spanning a single or multiple buffers!
 - New test App_ImageFunctions: tests image type/format conversion, nearest
   and bilinear sampling, loading and saving in JPG, PNG, TGA, TIFF formats.
 - MorphingActor test simplified and enhanced to show multiple animations.
 - App_Texturing test: now is a unified test checking 2D textures, 3D textures,
