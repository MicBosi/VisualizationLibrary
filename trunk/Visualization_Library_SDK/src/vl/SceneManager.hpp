  /**
   * The SceneManager class is the base class for all the scene managers.
   *
   * A SceneManager implements an algorithm used to quickly identify which objects are visible and which ones are not.
   * The algorithm can be a space partitioning scheme like a BSP, Kd-Tree, Octree etc. or a visibility based scheme like
   * sector/portals, precomputed PVS etc. or a mix of them. The set of SceneManager[s] attached to a Rendering
   * defines the scene. In fact, if an Actor does not belong to any SceneManager it will not have any chance of being rendered.
   *
   * Visualization Library allows you to bind and use multiple SceneManagers at the same time within the same Rendering.
   * Note that an Actor should belong to one and only one SceneManager otherwise you might end up rendering twice the same Actor
   * thus wasting computational resources.
   *
   * In order to implement your own scene manager you will have to dirive from the SceneManager class and provide an appropriate
   * implementation for the following methods: extractVisibleActors(), extractActors().
   * 
   * \sa
   * - ActorKdTree
   * - ActorTree
   * - SceneManager
   * - SceneManagerActorKdTree

   * - SceneManagerPortals
