    From Wikipedia [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bézier_surface">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bézier_surface</a>]:

    <i>"Bézier surfaces are a species of mathematical spline used in computer graphics, computer-aided design, and finite element modelling. As with the Bézier curve, a Bézier surface is defined by a set of control points. Similar to interpolation in many respects, a key difference is that the surface does not, in general, pass through the central control points; rather, it is "stretched" toward them as though each were an attractive force. They are visually intuitive, and for many applications, mathematically convenient."

    "Bézier surfaces were first described in 1972 by the French engineer Pierre Bézier who used them to design automobile bodies. Bézier surfaces can be of any degree, but bicubic Bézier surfaces generally provide enough degrees of freedom for most applications."</i>
